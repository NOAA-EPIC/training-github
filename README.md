# Contributing to UFS/EPIC GitHub Repositories

## Welcome to NOAA-EPIC/training-github!

## Prerequisites

1. A laptop, preferably a Mac or Linux system.  A Windows system can also work if using a Windows Terminal or PuTTY, and downloading Git-Bash 
2. Verify that you have git (or Git-Bash on Windows) installed on your system: `git --version` (Note that version 2.30+ is recommended for working with UFS repositories; not required for today). 
   - If you have root privileges on Linux, then you can follow [these instructions for updating your version of git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
   - On MacOS, you could use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager to [install git](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/git). 
   - If you are on a Windows machine, you can download and install [Git-Bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
3. Next, create a GitHub account if you do not already have one: [GitHub Signup](https://github.com/signup)
